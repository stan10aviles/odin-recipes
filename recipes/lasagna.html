        <li>Bertoli Spaghetti Sauce</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Ground Beef</li>
        <li>No-Boil Lasagna Noodles</li>
      
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>The first step is to preheat your oven to 350 F. Next, brown your ground beef.
            You can always substitute ground beef with ground turkey, chicken, or sausage.
            You can really chose whatever you and your family prefer most. Once browned, drain the grease.</li>
        <li>Next, lay out all of your ingredients so you can begin to layer the lasagna. First,
            spread about Â¼ Cup of pasta sauce along the base of the baking dish.</li>
        <li>Next, spread 1/3 of your beef mixture on top of the sauce, evenly distributing.</li>
        <li>Once meat is on, layer the top of the meat with 1/4th of the cheddar cheese.</li>
        <li>Then, place the noodle sheets on top. You can cut the edges or break a few in half if
            necessary to make it fit your particular dish.</li>
        <li>Last, place dabs of the butter on top of the noodles. Do this combination of layering two more times.</li>
        <li>Once you have done all the layering, end by placing another 1/4th cup of sauce on
            the noodles and sprinkling with cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake for 40 minutes. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
