    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425ÂºF and coat the inside of a 9-inch pie plate, cast iron skillet, or 8x8
            casserole dish with non-stick spray (or butter for more flavor).</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, stir together the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder,
            and salt until evenly combined.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, and oil.</li>
        <li>Pour the bowl of wet ingredients into the bowl of dry ingredients and stir just until everything is
            moist. Avoid over stirring. It's okay if there are a few lumps.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared dish and bake for about 20 minutes, or until the top and
            edges are golden brown. Cut into 8 pieces and serve.</li>
